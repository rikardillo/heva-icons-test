## Heva Icons Test

In order to provide a consistent look and feel of the icons used throughout our platform, react-icons offers an enormous amount of options free of cost that are flexible and scalable enough to suit our needs.

This small project is testing ground for **R&D** regarding this subject.

## Getting started:

The test was built using NextJS and Tailwind CSS for purposes of simplicity.

As with any React project:
1. Clone the repository
2. Run ```npm install``` to install project dependencies
3. ```npm run dev``` to run the localhost server.

### Highlights

Using a few extra tools for consistency. Mainly

- [Tailwind Prettier Plugin](https://tailwindcss.com/blog/automatic-class-sorting-with-prettier), for automatic sorting of the Tailwind Classes.
